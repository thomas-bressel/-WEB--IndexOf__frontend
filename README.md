# IndexOf>_ : A Tool Against Digital Forgetfulness

![IndexOf Logo](https://indexof.thomas-bressel.com/indexof-logo-black.png)

IndexOf>_ is an application designed to address a dual challenge: facilitating access to technical information for developers while rehabilitating active learning through memorization.

## üéØ Project Vision

This project was born from a personal and pedagogical observation: over the past 25 years, I have witnessed a noticeable decline in concentration and memorization abilities among my students, a trend that has accelerated with the evolution of digital technologies. While easier access to information is useful, it tends to deprive users of the effort necessary for deep assimilation.

IndexOf>_ deliberately takes a counter-current stance:
- It doesn't seek to automate knowledge, but to promote its appropriation
- It offers "digital cheat sheets," inspired by the summaries we used to write in school ‚Äî effective not for cheating, but for learning
- These condensed sheets, deliberately decontextualized, help retain recurring syntaxes or structures in development (code patterns, regular expressions, commands, etc.)
